# GDSC React Mentorship Starter

This starter template is designed for the GDSC React Mentorship program. It includes React, Vite, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this starter template, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to use the GDSC React Mentorship Starter:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/gdsc-org/gdsc-react-mentorship-starter.git

   Change into the project directory:

2. cd gdsc-react-mentorship-starter

Install the project dependencies using npm:
 ```shell
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

 ```shell
npm run dev
```

4. This command will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. Any changes you make to the code will automatically reload the application.

Open your preferred text editor and navigate to the src directory. Here you will find the main App.js file, which is the entry point for your React application. You can start building your application by modifying this file and creating additional components.



Build your application for production:

 ```shell
npm run build
```

This command will create an optimized production build of your application in the `dist` directory. You can deploy this build to a web server or hosting platform of your choice.
